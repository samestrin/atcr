## Problem

Epic 3.4 added unit tests proving EmitOpts.Diag / ReadOpts.Writer routing at the scorecard layer, but there is no test asserting the wiring itself — that the MCP handler passes a non-default writer or that the three CLI entry points pass cmd.ErrOrStderr(). This plumbing can silently regress (a future refactor swaps cmd.ErrOrStderr() back to a default and no test fails). (Deferred: Epic Plan 3.6 scorecard-wiring-tests)

## Fix

Add a CLI-level test that drives a scorecard command against a deliberately-malformed store and asserts the read diagnostic reaches the command's ErrOrStderr buffer; once MCP diagnostics route through e.log, add a handler-level test asserting against a captured logger buffer.
