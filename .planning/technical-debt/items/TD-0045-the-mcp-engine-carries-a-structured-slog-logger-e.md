## Problem

The MCP engine carries a structured *slog.Logger (e.log) used for every other diagnostic in handleReconcile (e.g. the require_verified warning at line ~225), but scorecard diagnostics are routed to raw os.Stderr, so MCP-path scorecard write-failures/malformed-record/orphan-verdict warnings emit as unstructured plaintext that bypasses the logger's level filtering, formatting, and sink redirection. NOTE: this was a DELIBERATE, documented epic decision (Clarifications Q2: supply os.Stderr at the call site; adapting e.log to an io.Writer was explicitly OUT of scope), so this is enhancement debt, not a regression. (intent_note: deferred per epic Clarifications Q2 — adapting e.log to an io.Writer is out of scope) (Wontfix: ACCEPTED ENHANCEMENT DEBT — handlers.go:220 is an unconditional EmitOpts{Diag: os.Stderr} call, not deferred logic; all five Epic 3.4 ACs are met and the comment at handlers.go:214-219 satisfies AC4; e.log→io.Writer adaptation is out of scope per Clarifications Q2; confirmed via /sprint-clarification 97%)

## Fix

If MCP observability is later desired, adapt e.log into an io.Writer shim (slog-backed at Warn level) and pass it as Diag instead of os.Stderr, so MCP-path scorecard diagnostics flow through the same structured pipeline as the rest of the handler. Defer unless/until structured MCP diagnostics are required.
