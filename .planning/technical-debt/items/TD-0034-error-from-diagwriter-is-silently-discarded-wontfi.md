## Problem

Error from diagWriter is silently discarded (Wontfix: intentional best-effort `_, _ =` diagnostics discard; the diagnostic already routes to the injectable writer, only fmt.Fprintf's own return is dropped; propagating it breaks Emit's never-fail contract)

## Fix

Log or return the error from fmt.Fprintf
