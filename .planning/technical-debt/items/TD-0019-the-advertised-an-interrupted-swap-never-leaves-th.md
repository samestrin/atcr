## Problem

The advertised "an interrupted swap never leaves the user with neither generation" invariant is conditional on a best-effort SILENT restore succeeding. If restorePriorBackup's os.Rename(backupOld,backup) fails (e.g. backup partially recreated, or perms change), the only surviving copy is stranded under .bak.old — which the very next run's entry-time RemoveAll(backupOld) (line 318) then deletes. Same pattern at the copy site swapStagedBackup (atomic.go:159-167) feeding atomic.go:97 RemoveAll(bakOld). (Won't-fix 2026-06-20: observability half done (restore failure now logged); the lone-.bak.old-as-generation redesign is rejected per Epic 4.7.1 Q3 — .bak.old is atcr-owned temp deleted at entry, one-generation contract + TestBackupExisting_CleansStaleStagingStragglers stand; confirmed via /sprint-clarification 95%)

## Fix

Surface restore failures loudly (log/return) instead of dropping them, and/or do not auto-RemoveAll .bak.old at entry when .bak is absent — treat a lone .bak.old as the surviving generation to recover. Add a test where restore fails and a subsequent run is asserted not to delete the only surviving copy.
