## Problem

Error from diagWriter is silently discarded (Wontfix: FALSE POSITIVE — `_, _ = fmt.Fprintf` is the documented best-effort never-panic diagnostics contract at store.go:22-24; returning the write error would regress a successful read on a broken sink and logging is circular; confirmed working as designed via /sprint-clarification 97%)

## Fix

Log or return the error from fmt.Fprintf
