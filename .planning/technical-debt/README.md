| 1 | [ ] | LOW | internal/atomicfs/atomic.go:12 | atomicfs package coverage is 75.5% (below the 80% per-package guideline; module-wide is 89.6%) because WriteFileAtomic Write/Chmod/Close and BackupToDotBak/copyTree error-return branches lack fault-injection seams | Add a small fault-injection seam (e.g. injectable file ops) to exercise the error returns, or accept the defensive branches as untested | TESTING | 30 | execute-epic-cumulative |
| 1 | [ ] | LOW | internal/atomicfs/atomic.go:195 | BackupToDotBak RemoveAll(bak) then copies non-atomically; a crash between RemoveAll and copy completion loses the prior .bak generation (live source stays intact, so only the backup is at risk) | Acceptable for a recovery aid; optionally copy to a temp sibling then rename for crash-safe backup replacement | EDGE_CASES | 30 | execute-epic-independent |
| 1 | [ ] | LOW | internal/atomicfs/atomic.go:240 | copyTree silently skips symlinks and other non-regular entries so a reconciled/ tree containing a symlinked artifact would back up incomplete; plan assumes plain files only | Document the plain-files assumption or error/log when a non-regular entry is skipped during a backup | EDGE_CASES | 15 | execute-epic-independent |
| U | [ ] | LOW | internal/fanout/reviewdir.go:210 | Explicit-id collision error names CLI flags --resume/--force but is also surfaced to MCP clients via PrepareReview (internal/mcp/handlers.go) which have no such flags | Provide an MCP-specific or flag-neutral collision error when PrepareReview is invoked from the MCP handler | CORRECTNESS | 30 | execute-epic-stage3 |
| U | [ ] | LOW | internal/verify/emit_verification.go:149 | AC5 backup is implemented twice (WriteVerification adds BackupExistingVerification AND runVerify adds it) but production verify only goes through runVerify/writeGroupAtomic so WriteVerification is test-only; two copies can drift | Note that WriteVerification has no non-test callers or collapse to a single backup site to avoid future divergence | REGRESSION_RISK | 30 | execute-epic-independent |
| U | [ ] | LOW | internal/fanout/reviewdir.go:285 | forceBackupReviewDir/forceBackupOutputDir back up without emitting any user-facing message (unlike the epic-plan sketch which printed Backed up existing review to <dir>) | Print a stderr notice naming the .bak path on --force so the destructive backup is visible to the user | OBSERVABILITY | 15 | execute-epic-independent |

| 2 | [/] | MEDIUM | internal/fanout/metrics.go:37 | recordAgentOutcome zeroes apiCalls for any result whose error unwraps to context.DeadlineExceeded/Canceled, assuming no request was made. But a per-agent timeout routinely fires AFTER real HTTP round-trips (and mid tool-loop after several Chat turns already hit the wire), so atcr_api_calls_total undercounts real provider traffic exactly when a provider is degraded. The no-request assumption is only provably safe for CircuitOpenError and pre-first-send cancellation. (Deferred: Epic Plan 4.11) | Use max(1, r.Turns) for the deadline case instead of a flat 0, or thread a real calls-attempted counter out of the client rather than inferring from the terminal error class. Keep the apiCalls=0 path only for CircuitOpenError. | performance | 60 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |

Pre-existing in the CLI-shared path, newly reachable via MCP shutdown. | Gate the interrupted marker on at least one agent ending in StatusTimeout/cancelled rather than purely on parent ctx.Err()==Canceled. NOTE: touches CLI-shared review.go (out of scope for epic 4.1.2's MCP-only change); window is microscopic and outcome benign (resume no-ops a complete run) - separate design.

The exact-value secret-scrubbing loop in Redact is therefore dead in production; redaction relies entirely on the `sk-`/`Bearer` regexes, which miss raw provider keys that lack those prefixes (Google `AIzaSy...`, Azure `api-key`, JWTs `eyJ...`). The AC5 "no API key in log output" guarantee holds only for sk-/Bearer-shaped keys; the passing integration test likely uses an sk- key, masking the gap. (Deferred: Epic Plan 4.9 secret-value-redaction) | Thread resolved registry API key values into `NewRedactor(root, keys...)` at both review.go:172 and handlers.go:87 (keys are discoverable from prep.Slots / cfg.Registry). Add an integration test using a non-sk-shaped key (e.g. `AIzaSy...`) asserting it is redacted. | security | 120 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |

(Won't fix: structural guard — reconcile copy-on-init at merge.go:29-31 means no consumer writes stream.SeverityRank directly; grep confirms zero write sites across consumers. Snapshot test trips the over-simplification gate; Rank() accessor cascades to 14+ direct-lookup sites — both out of pure-consolidation scope.) | Add a stream test that snapshots the map and asserts it is unchanged after consumers run, or wrap it behind a Rank(sev) accessor. | OBSERVABILITY | 20 | execute-epic-independent |

This plumbing can silently regress (a future refactor swaps cmd.ErrOrStderr() back to a default and no test fails). (Deferred: Epic Plan 3.6 scorecard-wiring-tests) | Add a CLI-level test that drives a scorecard command against a deliberately-malformed store and asserts the read diagnostic reaches the command's ErrOrStderr buffer; once MCP diagnostics route through e.log, add a handler-level test asserting against a captured logger buffer. | testing | 60 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |

NOTE: this was a DELIBERATE, documented epic decision (Clarifications Q2: supply os.Stderr at the call site; adapting e.log to an io.Writer was explicitly OUT of scope), so this is enhancement debt, not a regression. (intent_note: deferred per epic Clarifications Q2 — adapting e.log to io.Writer is out of scope) (Wontfix: ACCEPTED ENHANCEMENT DEBT — handlers.go:220 is an unconditional EmitOpts{Diag: os.Stderr} call, not deferred logic; all five Epic 3.4 ACs are met and the comment at handlers.go:214-219 satisfies AC4; e.log→io.Writer adaptation is out of scope per Clarifications Q2; confirmed via /sprint-clarification 97%) | If MCP observability is later desired, adapt e.log into an io.Writer shim (slog-backed at Warn level) and pass it as Diag instead of os.Stderr, so MCP-path scorecard diagnostics flow through the same structured pipeline as the rest of the handler.
