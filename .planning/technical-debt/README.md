### [2026-06-19] From Sprint: 4.6_rate_limit_backoff

|-------|---|----------|------|---------|-----|----------|-------------|--------|---------|----------|
| 1 | [x] | LOW | internal/llmclient/client.go:424 | The added delay=clampBackoff(delay) before the loop is correct but its comment claims it guards a misconfigured initial_backoff OR a direct WithRetryOverride. In practice the registry caps initial_backoff_ms at exactly maxBackoff (30000ms == 30s), so for every config-sourced value the clamp is a strict no-op; the only input it can actually clamp is a hand-rolled WithRetryOverride exceeding 30s, which is untested. The comment implies broader coverage than exists. | Tighten the comment to state the only real source is a direct WithRetryOverride, and add a unit test passing WithRetryOverride(ctx, n, 60*time.Second) asserting the first sleep is capped at 30s (fails without line 424). | testing | 15 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |
| 1 | [x] | MEDIUM | internal/llmclient/retry_override.go:26 | WithRetryOverride clamps a negative maxRetries to 0 but performs no guard on initialBackoff, while its doc claims it applies the same guard as WithRetry. A negative or absurd duration from a direct caller flows into dispatch; clampBackoff only bounds the upper end (d > maxBackoff), so a negative base survives and jitter/sleepCtx treat it as fire-immediately. Production config is validated (>=1ms) so this only affects direct callers, but the guard is advertised and only half-applied. (disagreement: LOW vs MEDIUM) | Floor initialBackoff inside WithRetryOverride (clamp <0 to 0 or a 1ms minimum), symmetric with the maxRetries clamp. Add a unit test passing a negative duration and asserting a non-negative stored value. | error-handling | 15 | code-review | claude, greta, bruce | HIGH |
| 1 | [x] | LOW | internal/llmclient/retry_override.go:35 | context.WithValue uses unexported key struct; safe but non-idiomatic | Consider using a typed context key variable for clarity | maintainability | 5 | code-review | bruce | MEDIUM |
| U | [x] | MEDIUM | internal/fanout/engine.go:450 | Incorrect sentinel for retry override | Change `a.InitialBackoffMs > 0` to check if the budget was explicitly resolved | correctness | 15 | code-review | otto | MEDIUM |
| U | [x] | MEDIUM | internal/fanout/engine.go:456 | The retry-override gate keys off a.InitialBackoffMs>0 as the configured sentinel, overloading one knob to also carry MaxRetries. A directly-constructed Agent that sets only max_retries=0 (single attempt, fail-fast) with no initial_backoff_ms is silently ignored. Config-loaded agents are unaffected because EffectiveInitialBackoffMs always inherits the resolved global (>=1), so this only bites bare/library Agent construction — but the struct comment presents a clean two-state contract when it is really three-state with a silent drop of MaxRetries. (disagreement: LOW vs MEDIUM) | Carry an explicit bool (e.g. RetryConfigured) or use a pointer on Agent to decouple apply-override from the backoff value, OR reword the comment to state MaxRetries is applied ONLY when InitialBackoffMs>0 so a caller setting MaxRetries alone knows it is ignored. | correctness | 30 | code-review | bruce, claude | HIGH |
| U | [x] | LOW | internal/registry/precedence.go:51 | MaxInitialBackoffMs (30000) and DefaultInitialBackoffMs (500) are hand-copied to equal llmclient's maxBackoff (30s) and defaultInitialBackoff (500ms), bound only by a comment across a package boundary. If maxBackoff or defaultInitialBackoff changes in llmclient, the registry silently drifts: it would keep rejecting newly-valid bases or accept bases the engine clamps, contradicting the validation's stated purpose and the unchanged-behavior comment. | Export the llmclient constants and reference them, or add a registry test asserting MaxInitialBackoffMs == int(maxBackoff/time.Millisecond) and DefaultInitialBackoffMs == int(defaultInitialBackoff/time.Millisecond) so drift fails CI. | maintainability | 30 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |
| U | [x] | LOW | internal/registry/precedence.go:172 | ResolveSettings re-validates per-agent max_retries/initial_backoff_ms by walking reg.Agents, duplicating the identical range checks in validateAgent (config.go) and the global checks, now in three places with two different error-string formats (agent %q: vs agent '%s':). A future bound change must touch three sites and a caller sees inconsistent messages depending on which path rejects. The defense-in-depth intent (catch directly-constructed registries bypassing LoadRegistry) is valid but argues for one shared validator. | Extract a single validateRetryBounds(maxRetries, backoffMs *int, label string) helper and call it from validate(), validateAgent(), and ResolveSettings() with a consistent error prefix. Verify retry_config_test.go still passes and error strings unify. | maintainability | 30 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |
| U | [x] | MEDIUM | internal/verify/invoke.go:118 | buildSkepticAgent forwards derefInt(c.MaxRetries)/derefInt(c.InitialBackoffMs) raw rather than resolving through EffectiveMaxRetries/EffectiveInitialBackoffMs like buildAgent. A skeptic that omits retry config derefs both to 0, so invokeAgent's InitialBackoffMs>0 gate never fires and the skeptic silently uses the bare llmclient default budget (2 retries), NOT the resolved global default of 5 that review/fallback agents get. Two agent classes hitting the same provider/account use different rate-limit resilience; the verify package never receives resolved Settings (select.go SelectEligibleSkeptics) so it is structurally unable to inherit the global tier. | Thread resolved registry.Settings into SelectEligibleSkeptics/Skeptic and call c.EffectiveMaxRetries(s)/c.EffectiveInitialBackoffMs(s) in buildSkepticAgent, matching buildAgent. If the divergence is intentional, document it in docs/registry.md and assert it in a test. Verify an unconfigured skeptic dispatches with maxRetries=5 not 2. | maintainability | 60 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |
| U | [x] | LOW | internal/verify/invoke_test.go:50 | The only skeptic retry test (TestBuildSkepticAgent_ForwardsProviderAndBudgets) sets explicit values (4/200) and asserts they forward, but never tests the unset case — the exact path where the skeptic wrongly drops to client-default 2 instead of the global 5. The test locks in the current behavior by omission and gives false confidence the wiring is complete. | After resolving the skeptic-budget inheritance gap, add a test where the skeptic config has nil retry pointers and assert the built Agent carries the resolved global budget, proving parity with review agents. | testing | 15 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |

| U | [x] | LOW | internal/fanout/engine.go:458 | The per-agent effective retry budget (max_retries/initial_backoff_ms) is applied silently; the "invoking agent" debug log omits it, so diagnosing rate-limit retry behavior in production requires inference. | Add max_retries and initial_backoff_ms to the agentLogger.Debug("invoking agent", ...) fields. | CROSS_CUTTING | 15 | execute-epic-cumulative |
| U | [x] | LOW | internal/verify/invoke.go:118 | A skeptic that leaves max_retries unset gets the bare shared-client default budget (2), not the resolved global default (5) the review path delivers, because buildSkepticAgent has no access to resolved Settings — an inconsistency between the verify and review paths (consistent with how skeptic TimeoutSecs already ignores global Settings, and documented in the code comment). | Thread resolved Settings into the verify invoke path so buildSkepticAgent can resolve retry via EffectiveMaxRetries like buildAgent, or accept the documented bare-client fallback as intended. | INTEGRATION | 30 | execute-epic-independent |

| 2 | [/] | MEDIUM | internal/fanout/metrics.go:37 | recordAgentOutcome zeroes apiCalls for any result whose error unwraps to context.DeadlineExceeded/Canceled, assuming no request was made. But a per-agent timeout routinely fires AFTER real HTTP round-trips (and mid tool-loop after several Chat turns already hit the wire), so atcr_api_calls_total undercounts real provider traffic exactly when a provider is degraded. The no-request assumption is only provably safe for CircuitOpenError and pre-first-send cancellation. (Deferred: Epic Plan 4.11) | Use max(1, r.Turns) for the deadline case instead of a flat 0, or thread a real calls-attempted counter out of the client rather than inferring from the terminal error class. Keep the apiCalls=0 path only for CircuitOpenError. | performance | 60 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |

Pre-existing in the CLI-shared path, newly reachable via MCP shutdown. | Gate the interrupted marker on at least one agent ending in StatusTimeout/cancelled rather than purely on parent ctx.Err()==Canceled. NOTE: touches CLI-shared review.go (out of scope for epic 4.1.2's MCP-only change); window is microscopic and outcome benign (resume no-ops a complete run) - separate design.

(Deferred: Epic Plan 4.1.2) | Decide whether detached MCP reviews should be marked interrupted on server shutdown; if so, thread a cancellable/interrupt-aware context or post-hoc marker into the background review path — a separate design from this CLI-focused epic. | REGRESSION_RISK | 60 | execute-epic-independent |

The exact-value secret-scrubbing loop in Redact is therefore dead in production; redaction relies entirely on the `sk-`/`Bearer` regexes, which miss raw provider keys that lack those prefixes (Google `AIzaSy...`, Azure `api-key`, JWTs `eyJ...`). The AC5 "no API key in log output" guarantee holds only for sk-/Bearer-shaped keys; the passing integration test likely uses an sk- key, masking the gap. (Deferred: Epic Plan 4.9 secret-value-redaction) | Thread resolved registry API key values into `NewRedactor(root, keys...)` at both review.go:172 and handlers.go:87 (keys are discoverable from prep.Slots / cfg.Registry).

(Won't fix: structural guard — reconcile copy-on-init at merge.go:29-31 means no consumer writes stream.SeverityRank directly; grep confirms zero write sites across consumers. Snapshot test trips the over-simplification gate; Rank() accessor cascades to 14+ direct-lookup sites — both out of pure-consolidation scope.) | Add a stream test that snapshots the map and asserts it is unchanged after consumers run, or wrap it behind a Rank(sev) accessor. | OBSERVABILITY | 20 | execute-epic-independent |

This plumbing can silently regress (a future refactor swaps cmd.ErrOrStderr() back to a default and no test fails). (Deferred: Epic Plan 3.6 scorecard-wiring-tests) | Add a CLI-level test that drives a scorecard command against a deliberately-malformed store and asserts the read diagnostic reaches the command's ErrOrStderr buffer; once MCP diagnostics route through e.log, add a handler-level test asserting against a captured logger buffer. | testing | 60 | code-review | claude | MEDIUM |

| 7 | [/] | LOW | internal/verify/pipeline.go:238 | The rich VerificationResult built in verifyFinding never populates TrippedBudgets (invokeSkeptic folds tripped budgets only into free-text Notes), base.Model is hard-coded to skeptics[0].Config.Model even when another skeptic produced the winning verdict, and the skip-already-verified rebuild (pipeline.go:199) re-synthesizes records from the compact on-disk block losing Model/DurationMs/TrippedBudgets — so verification.json's structured audit fields degrade or misattribute on multi-skeptic and no-op re-runs (extends the model-attribution gap of TD-011). Also: Model is empty on the no_eligible_skeptic / tool_harness_unavailable early-return paths. [intent: deferred per sprint-plan TD-011] | Thread the tripped-budget slice and the winning skeptic's model up from invokeSkeptic into base.TrippedBudgets/base.Model (join models when multiple voters agree, mirroring joinSkeptics), and carry Model/DurationMs/TrippedBudgets forward for skipped findings instead of synthesizing a lossy record. | correctness | 120 | execute-sprint | execute-sprint, claude | HIGH |

### [2026-06-19] From Epic: 4.8_mcp_test_coverage (demoted from active epic)

> Epic 4.8 was retired on 2026-06-19: its premise (`internal/mcp` below the 80% baseline) is obsolete — the package is at 84.1%, and the `drain`/`handleReview` targets are already met. The residual under-covered error branches are tracked here as test-only TD instead of a standalone epic.

| Solo | [ ] | LOW | internal/mcp/handlers.go:521 | handleVerify is at 63% — its error branches (verify-registry load failure, invalid severity, range-resolution failure) have no test asserting the structured client-facing error. | Add table-driven tests for the three failure paths asserting the structured error (type/category + stable substring); reach ≥85%. | testing | 30 | epic-review | claude | MEDIUM |
| Solo | [ ] | LOW | internal/mcp/handlers.go:605 | parseOptionalSeverity is at 75% — blank and invalid inputs are untested. | Add valid / blank / invalid cases → 100%. | testing | 10 | epic-review | claude | MEDIUM |

| Solo | [ ] | LOW | internal/mcp/handlers.go:347 | handleReport is at 76% — the markdown radar branch (Epic 3.2) and error paths (missing reconciled data, corrupt/absent ambiguous.json degrading gracefully) are uncovered. | Add tests for the radar branch and the degradation paths → ≥85%. | testing | 20 | epic-review | claude | MEDIUM |
| Solo | [ ] | LOW | internal/mcp/handlers.go:402 | handleStatus is at 81.8% — the corrupt-manifest path is untested. | Add a corrupt-manifest test → ≥90%. | testing | 10 | epic-review | claude | MEDIUM |
